inspect 1.x, 2015-02-12
-----------------------
- Ported back from Drupal module Inspect 7.x-6.3.
  The concepts and essential code of Inspect was originally developed in
  non-Drupal contexts (like ZZ; a SourceForge project).
  And no other developer than yours sincerely has delivered a single line of
  code to this library. The bodies of some methods of the (Drupal) Inspect
  7.x-6.3 version were straight copies of Drupal 7 core (validUtf8(),
  truncateBytes(), cliMode()); however these methods will consist of unique
  code (or simply disappear) before the first release of the library.
- Fixed namespace; uppercase'd ...\Inspect.
- Added MIT license.
- Permissions to get and frontend log now reflect the PHP display_errors setting.
- ::permit() throw LogicException if unsupported output target.
- ::nspct() throw specific RuntimeException|OverflowException|LogicException instead of generic Exception.
