inspect 1.x, 2015-02-14
-----------------------
- Removed method cliMode(), use PHP_SAPI === 'cli' instead.
- Fixed UTF-8 validity checker and byte truncater.
- Make sure session counting is initialised (if conf session_counters),
  even if we don't listen to any request init event.

inspect 1.x, 2015-02-13
-----------------------
- Configuration vars are now domain specific.

inspect 1.x, 2015-02-12
-----------------------
- Ported from Drupal module Inspect 7.x-6.3.
  The concepts and essential code of Inspect was originally developed in
  non-Drupal contexts (like ZZ; a SourceForge project).
  And since Drupal Inspect 7.x-6.0 that backbone has been designed specifically
  to be usable in any PHP context, not only the Drupal context.
- Fixed namespace; uppercase'd ...\Inspect.
- Added MIT license.
- Permissions to get and frontend log now reflect the PHP display_errors setting.
- ::permit() throw LogicException if unsupported output target.
- ::nspct() throw specific RuntimeException|OverflowException|LogicException instead of generic Exception.
