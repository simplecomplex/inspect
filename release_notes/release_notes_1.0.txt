SimpleComplex Inspect 1.0


Main issues
-----------
XXX

New features
------------
- Backend and frontend: category is now an alias of type (instead of vice versa)
  and the use of category is deprecated.
- New instance var code, usable for event or error code.
- Now supports logging via injected PSR-3 logger; instance var (object) logger.

Bug fixes
---------
- Fixed frontend file:line resolver; failed to identify inspect.js self.
- Frontend: stricter typeOf() array check; some jQuery extensions (old
  dataTables) were erroneously assessed as array.
